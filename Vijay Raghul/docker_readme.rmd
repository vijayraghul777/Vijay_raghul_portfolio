This is a Dockerfile, which is a script used to create a Docker image. Docker images are like templates that contain everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

Let's break down each line of this Dockerfile:

1. `FROM nginx:alpine`
   - This line specifies the base image to use for building this image. In this case, it uses the `nginx:alpine` image, which is a lightweight Linux distribution (Alpine) with the Nginx web server pre-installed.

2. `WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html`
   - This line sets the working directory inside the container. It means that when the container starts, it will default to the directory `/usr/share/nginx/html`.

3. `COPY . .`
   - This line copies the contents of the current directory (where the Dockerfile is located) into the `/usr/share/nginx/html` directory inside the container. This is where Nginx typically looks for files to serve.

4. `EXPOSE 80`
   - This line informs Docker that the container will listen on port 80 at runtime. However, it doesn't actually publish the port. It's more of a documentation for people who might use this image to know which ports to map.

5. `CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]`
   - This line sets the default command to be executed when a container starts from this image. It runs the Nginx web server with the parameters `-g "daemon off;"`. The `-g` flag allows passing configuration directives, and `"daemon off;"` keeps Nginx running in the foreground (as opposed to running as a background daemon).

In summary, this Dockerfile is instructing Docker to:

1. Use the `nginx:alpine` image as the base.
2. Set the working directory to where Nginx expects its files.
3. Copy the files from the current directory into the container.
4. Inform Docker that the container will listen on port 80 (though it doesn't actually publish it by default).
5. Start Nginx when a container is launched, and keep it running in the foreground.

This Dockerfile essentially creates a containerized environment with an Nginx web server serving the files present in the same directory as the Dockerfile.
